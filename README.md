# 📌 Project Overview

SimTraffic AI is an intelligent traffic congestion prediction and traffic management system developed using **Machine Learning**, **NetLogo Simulation**, **Flask REST API**, and **React.js**.

The system simulates road traffic using NetLogo, generates traffic datasets, trains a Machine Learning model, predicts congestion levels, and provides intelligent traffic management recommendations through a modern interactive dashboard.

Unlike a traditional traffic prediction project, SimTraffic AI also provides practical decision support for traffic controllers by estimating vehicle delay and recommending adaptive traffic signal timing.

# 🚀 Novel Features

Unlike basic traffic prediction systems, SimTraffic AI introduces several intelligent decision-support features.

### 🚨 Traffic Severity Meter

Displays congestion risk using an interactive severity meter.

Example:

- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH
- CRITICAL

---

### ⏱ Intelligent Delay Estimation

The system estimates expected vehicle waiting time using traffic parameters instead of displaying only congestion classes.

Example

```
Estimated Delay

8.4 minutes
```

---

### 🚦 Adaptive Signal Recommendation

The system recommends signal timing adjustments according to congestion level.

Example

```
Increase Green Signal Time by 25 Seconds
```

---

### 🧭 Traffic Management Recommendation

Provides actionable guidance for traffic controllers.

Example

```
Priority should be given to the highly congested road.
```

---

### 📄 Download Prediction Report

Users can generate a professional PDF report containing:

- Prediction Result
- Delay Estimation
- Congestion Risk
- Signal Recommendation
- Traffic Management Recommendation
- Report Generation Date

---

### 📊 Interactive Analytics Dashboard

Dashboard includes
